## Additional Directories & Assets
- `images/`: All imagery is RLHF-themed (training loops, PPO, etc.). Create or source Sentinel diagrams (architecture, data connectors, SOC workflow, ROI charts) and Microsoft-approved cover art. Update filenames and ensure alt text matches new content.
- `favicon.ico`: Replace with Sentinel/Defender compliant favicon.
- `data/library.json`: Currently powers an RLHF model comparison library. Determine if whitepaper needs interactive assets; otherwise delete or repurpose for Sentinel solution catalog (customers, connectors).
- `scripts/generate_library.py`: Dependent on Hugging Face dataset. Either remove from distribution or rebuild to produce Sentinel reference data (e.g., compliance mappings). Update dependency documentation accordingly.
- `templates/*.html`, `templates/pdf.tex`, `templates/docx.docx`, `templates/style.css`: Rebrand to Microsoft Sentinel styling (color palette, typography guidance). Update header/footer, navigation, and ToC structure to match whitepaper layout (single flowing document vs. many chapters).
- `templates/library.html`, `templates/nav.js`, `templates/header-anchors.js`: Audit for RLHF references; update labels, navigation order, and remove unused interactive elements if whitepaper becomes single page.
- `favicon.ico`, `images/rlhf-book-cover.png`, `images/rlhf-book-share.png`: Replace with Sentinel cover art and social share imagery.

## Metadata & Build Considerations
- `metadata.yml`: Update title/subtitle to reflect Sentinel whitepaper, adjust abstract, tags (`azure sentinel`, `security`, `siem`), publication date, author list (Microsoft or partner). Ensure licensing aligns with Microsoft policies (probably © Microsoft). Adjust header-includes if new brand requirements.
- `Makefile`: Rename outputs (`OUTPUT_FILENAME` -> `sentinel-whitepaper`, `OUTPUT_FILENAME_HTML` -> `index` or `sentinel`). Remove RLHF-specific build steps (library data copying). Review `FILTER_ARGS`, `BIBLIOGRAPHY` path if bibliography moved. Confirm `COVER_IMAGE` references new design.
- `README.md`: Replace RLHF book description with whitepaper overview, build instructions, prerequisites, and usage notes.
- `metadata.yml` geometry and fonts: Align with Microsoft publication standards (margins, fonts like Segoe UI—mind licensing). Update abstract to security context.
- `templates/ieee.csl`: Confirm citation style matches desired Microsoft formatting (may switch to APA or vendor-specific).

## Content Transformation Requirements
- Rewrite voice from academic tutorial to executive/solution whitepaper tone (business outcomes, security posture, ROI).
- Insert Microsoft Sentinel positioning statements, pricing/value points, integration lists (Defender, Entra, Purview).
- Incorporate customer/industry proof points, compliance certifications (FedRAMP, ISO, SOC 2, etc.).
- Provide implementation roadmap (phased deployment, success metrics, adoption timeline).
- Add monitoring KPIs (MTTD, MTTR, coverage), dashboards, automation outcomes.
- Include CTA (engage Microsoft, start trial, partner services).
- Remove RLHF terminology, formulas, algorithms; replace with security operations language and KQL examples.
- Validate technical accuracy with Sentinel documentation; cite official sources.

## Process & Governance Changes
- Establish whitepaper review workflow with product marketing, legal/compliance, security engineering.
- Update QA checklist to include fact-checking, brand compliance, accessibility (PDF tagging, alt text), link validation.
- Define rollout artifacts: PDF, HTML microsite copy, optional DOCX for localization.
- Create rollback plan via git tag (pre-conversion), documented in `todo.md`.
- Ensure licensing updates (copyright, Creative Commons removal if not applicable).
- Plan for analytics on downloads (if hosted) and content updates cadence.

## Open Items & Assumptions
- Audience priority assumed to be executive decision-makers unless guidance changes.
- Need confirmation on Microsoft brand templates and legal review requirements.
- Determine final length/format expectations (pages, word count, infographic count).
