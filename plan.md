1) Task Brief (from @task.md):
   - Goals: Transform the existing "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback" (RLHF) book manuscript into a Microsoft Azure Sentinel-focused whitepaper that positions Sentinel for security readers, replacing RLHF-specific narratives with Azure security operations content while leveraging existing build tooling.
   - Constraints: Follow whitepaper best practices (executive summary, problem framing, solution architecture, business value, implementation guidance). Keep documentation within this repo (todo.md as the only living work log). Prioritize simplicity and reuse of tooling (Pandoc/Makefile). Assume single writer/designer unless reassigned. Honor licensing and attribution requirements for any reused material.
   - Stakeholders: Azure Sentinel product marketing, Microsoft Security engineering, prospective Sentinel customers (CISOs, SOC leads), internal reviewer (Senior Engineer), CI/CD guardian.
   - Scope Boundaries: IN scope—content strategy, manuscript rewrite, imagery/table updates, metadata overhaul, build pipeline updates for whitepaper formats, QA/validation, rollout guidance. OUT of scope—new feature development in Sentinel, code changes beyond documentation tooling, external publishing logistics (unless clarified).
   - Non-Goals: Preserving RLHF-focused chapters, maintaining academic reference style unless directly useful, creating separate living design docs beyond todo.md.
   - Assumptions (resolved from open questions):
       1. Primary audience is executive security leadership (CISOs, SOC directors) with technical implementers supported via appendices and implementation detail callouts.
       2. Adopt Microsoft Azure brand guidance (Segoe UI/Calibri typography, Azure accent #0078D4/#00A1F1) and build lightweight custom template in repo—no external proprietary template import required.
       3. Target length is a 24–28 page PDF (~8.5k–9.5k words) with concise executive summary and detailed appendices.

2) Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria:
   - AC1: Manuscript reorganized into whitepaper sections (Executive Summary, Market Context, Challenges, Azure Sentinel Architecture Overview, Solution Narrative, Implementation Guide, Customer Evidence, ROI/Business Outcomes, Call to Action) with 100% of RLHF chapters either repurposed or retired.
   - AC2: Metadata, title page, and abstract updated to reference Azure Sentinel, include accurate publication date, and pass `make pdf` and `make html` builds without errors.
   - AC3: Minimum of six authoritative Azure Sentinel references (docs, case studies, compliance standards) cited and listed in updated bibliography.
   - AC4: Visual assets (figures/tables) reflect Sentinel workflows; any RLHF diagrams removed or replaced; all figures render successfully in generated outputs.
   - AC5: QA validation checklist confirms alignment with target audience needs and Microsoft security messaging; sign-off recorded in todo.md by QA Validator and Senior Engineer Reviewer.
   - AC6: Rollback plan documented, enabling restoration of original RLHF book via version control tags (or branch) with test instructions.

3) Phased Implementation Plan:
   - Phase 1: Scope & prerequisites
       * Audit current RLHF manuscript structure, assets, citations, and tooling.
       * Define whitepaper outline tailored to Sentinel, mapping existing content to new sections.
       * Gather authoritative Azure Sentinel resources, statistics, and approved messaging.
       * Document assumptions and answer open questions where possible.
   - Phase 2: Implementation & tests
       * Rewrite/restructure chapters into whitepaper sections with consistent tone and branding.
       * Update metadata (`metadata.yml`, title pages) and global navigation to reflect whitepaper.
       * Replace/add visual assets and tables relevant to Sentinel.
       * Update citation database (`bib.bib`) with Sentinel references; remove obsolete RLHF entries.
       * Execute build pipeline (PDF/HTML) and fix formatting, link, or lint issues.
   - Phase 3: Rollout & monitoring
       * Prepare release notes and deployment checklist in todo.md (monitoring & rollback).
       * Validate builds in CI/CD (local `make` targets or automation) and capture results.
       * Confirm stakeholder alignment, capture approvals, and package deliverables (e.g., PDF/HTML).
   - Phase 4: Hardening & follow-ups
       * Address feedback, polish narrative, ensure terminology consistency.
       * Establish metrics monitoring (downloads, engagement proxy) if applicable.
       * Document residual risks, backlog improvements, and future enhancement ideas.

4) Architecture (minimal):
   - Current State: Multi-chapter RLHF academic-style book built via Pandoc/Makefile pipeline; metadata references ML content; bibliography focused on RLHF research.
   - Target State: Single coherent Azure Sentinel whitepaper manuscript using same build pipeline but reorganized sections, Sentinel-focused metadata, updated assets, and refreshed citations.
   - Key Interfaces: `Makefile` build targets (pdf/html), `chapters/` markdown files, `metadata.yml`, `bib.bib`, image assets under `images/`, potential `templates/` for layout adjustments.
   - Data Flow: Markdown content → Pandoc templates → Outputs (PDF/HTML). Citations from `bib.bib`. Images referenced in markdown.
   - Risks/Tradeoffs: Rewriting vs. deleting content (risk of losing valuable context) balanced against need for focus; time to produce new graphics; potential gap in brand compliance; decision to reuse vs. replace pipeline.

5) Backlog Summary:
   - Epic WP-A Content Strategy (Critical Path)
       * Story WP-A1: Inventory existing RLHF content and map to Sentinel whitepaper outline.
       * Story WP-A2: Define target audience messaging hierarchy (executive vs technical).
       * Deliverables: D1 content audit matrix, D2 approved whitepaper outline.
   - Epic WP-B Manuscript Conversion (Critical Path)
       * Story WP-B1: Rewrite narrative sections (Exec Summary, Market Context, Problem Statement).
       * Story WP-B2: Author technical sections (Architecture, Implementation Guide, Monitoring).
       * Story WP-B3: Update citations and bibliography.
       * Deliverables: D3 rewritten markdown files, D4 updated `bib.bib`.
   - Epic WP-C Visual & Metadata Refresh
       * Story WP-C1: Curate/create Sentinel diagrams/screenshots compliant with branding.
       * Story WP-C2: Update `metadata.yml`, headers, and table of contents structure.
       * Deliverables: D5 updated image assets, D6 revised metadata/build config.
   - Epic WP-D QA, Release & Governance
       * Story WP-D1: Define QA validation checklist and execute review.
       * Story WP-D2: Run build/test pipeline and capture results.
       * Story WP-D3: Prepare rollout notes, rollback instructions, and stakeholder sign-offs.
       * Deliverables: D7 QA report, D8 build logs/tests, D9 release package & rollback notes.
   - Dependencies & Critical Path: WP-A → WP-B → WP-D. WP-C partially parallel but blockers if assets missing. Critical path items flagged.

6) Risk Register & Mitigations:
   - R1: Incomplete knowledge of Azure Sentinel features leads to inaccurate messaging → Mitigation: Source official Microsoft docs, engage SME or assume conservative language; document assumptions in todo.md.
   - R2: Lack of brand-compliant visuals → Mitigation: Use Microsoft public assets or create simple schematic placeholders pending approval; track in backlog.
   - R3: Build pipeline regressions after restructuring → Mitigation: Incremental testing of `make html`/`make pdf`, maintain rollback tag.
   - R4: Scope creep into broader Azure security topics → Mitigation: Anchor outline to Sentinel-specific value proposition; log any expansion requests as backlog items.
   - R5: Time constraints for comprehensive rewrite → Mitigation: Prioritize high-impact sections (Executive summary, solution architecture) first; track progress in todo.md Kanban.

7) Operational Readiness:
   - CI/CD Gates: Successful `make html` and `make pdf`; markdown lint (if available) passes; bibliography resolves without warnings.
   - SLO/SLI Impact: Ensure final whitepaper accessible (PDF/HTML size manageable <10MB); maintain build time under 5 minutes locally.
   - Rollback Criteria: If critical inaccuracies or build failures discovered post-release, revert to pre-whitepaper Git tag/branch and communicate via release notes.

8) Definition of Done:
   - Phase 1 DoD: Content audit completed, outline approved, open questions logged/answered or assumptions recorded; backlog updated with estimates/status.
   - Phase 2 DoD: All target sections rewritten with Sentinel focus, assets/citations updated, builds succeed locally, Kanban shows stories in Done awaiting QA.
   - Phase 3 DoD: QA checklist executed, stakeholder approvals captured, release artifacts stored, monitoring/rollback plan documented.
   - Phase 4 DoD: Feedback addressed, residual risks logged, future work backlog curated, final consensus meeting recorded.
   - Deliverable DoD: Each deliverable linked to backlog ID, reviewed (peer/self), build/test evidence captured in todo.md.

Open Question Tracking: No outstanding items; revisit assumptions only if stakeholder feedback contradicts them.
