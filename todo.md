# Journal (time-stamped entries only)
[2025-10-03T12:30:46-05:00] [Agent 3] Attempted WP-D2 build validation (`make html`); blocked by missing pandoc binary in local environment, will document dependency gap.
[2025-10-03T12:34:02-05:00] [Agent 2] Completed WP-C2 metadata and build configuration refresh; updated metadata.yml, Makefile outputs, templates, and README for Sentinel branding.
[2025-10-03T12:33:15-05:00] [Agent 2] Delivered WP-C1 visual refresh by replacing RLHF assets with Sentinel cover/share imagery and translating architecture figure into an executive-ready table.
[2025-10-03T12:32:00-05:00] [Agent 2] Finished WP-B3 by rebuilding chapters/bib.bib with Sentinel references and removing legacy RLHF data/scripts.
[2025-10-03T12:31:10-05:00] [Agent 2] Closed WP-B2 after rewriting technical architecture, operations, governance, and roadmap chapters for Sentinel deployment guidance.
[2025-10-03T12:29:38-05:00] [Agent 2] Completed WP-B1 executive narrative rewrite covering executive summary, threat landscape, and value proposition sections.
[2025-10-03T12:04:44-05:00] [Agent 2] Completed WP-A2 messaging hierarchy; documented audience pyramid and pillar mapping in analysis/wp-a2-messaging-hierarchy.md to steer content rewrite.
[2025-10-03T12:04:12-05:00] [Agent 2] Pulled WP-A2 into In-Progress to define messaging hierarchy for executive-led Sentinel whitepaper with technical appendices.
[2025-10-03T12:03:26-05:00] [Agent 5] Resolved outstanding assumptions: prioritize executive stakeholders, adopt Azure-branded in-repo template, target 24-28 page (~9k word) whitepaper unless new guidance arrives.
[2025-10-03T12:00:05-05:00] [Agent 2] Completed WP-A1 content inventory; documented Sentinel whitepaper mapping in analysis/wp-a1-content-audit.md and identified required global changes, leaving audience/branding/length questions open.
[2025-10-03T11:57:51-05:00] [Agent 2] Pulled WP-A1 into In-Progress to audit RLHF chapters and draft Sentinel mapping; proceeding with assumption that executive stakeholders take priority until clarified.
[2025-10-03T11:56:37-05:00] [Agent 1] Reviewed @task.md, inspected repository structure, authored @plan.md v1 covering Sentinel whitepaper conversion strategy, logged open questions about audience priority, brand templates, and target length.

# Architecture (Current)
- Microsoft Sentinel whitepaper reauthored across `chapters/` with executive-first narrative, Azure-branded templates, updated bibliography, and sentinel-focused assets; builds executed via existing Pandoc Makefile (pending dependency availability).

# Architecture (Target)
- Fully validated Sentinel whitepaper with automated build/test gates, QA checklist, and rollback guidance captured in repository workflows.

# Decisions (ADR-style, compact)
- [2025-10-03T12:03:26-05:00] Executive security leaders designated primary audience; maintain technical detail via appendices.
- [2025-10-03T12:03:26-05:00] Use Azure brand palette and custom Pandoc templates created in repo (no external template import).
- [2025-10-03T12:03:26-05:00] Aim for 24–28 page (~9k word) final PDF to meet whitepaper expectations.

# Risks & Mitigations (live)
- R1 Incomplete Sentinel domain knowledge → Mitigation: rely on official Microsoft sources, document assumptions before reuse.
- R2 Missing brand-compliant visuals → Mitigation: use available Microsoft public diagrams or craft placeholders pending approval.
- R3 Build regressions post-restructure → Mitigation: run `make html`/`make pdf` after each major change and maintain rollback tag.
- R4 Scope creep beyond Sentinel focus → Mitigation: enforce outline discipline; log new requests separately.
- R5 Time constraints for rewrite → Mitigation: prioritize executive summary and technical architecture first; track progress in Kanban.

# Test Matrix & Results (links to PRs / runs)
- [2025-10-03T12:30:46-05:00] make html (local) — failed: `pandoc` executable not found; action item: install Pandoc 3.x before rerun (WP-D2).

# Monitoring & Rollback Notes
- Rollback approach TBD; likely Git tag of pre-whitepaper state plus instructions once implementation begins.

# Future Work / Ideas
- Evaluate opportunity to create companion slide deck once whitepaper stabilizes.

# Changelog (what shipped when)
- None yet.
