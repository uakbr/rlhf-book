# Automation & Orchestration

Automation reduces analyst toil and enforces consistent response actions. Microsoft Sentinelâ€™s orchestration stack centers on Azure Logic Apps, automation rules, and playbooks.

## Playbook Design Principles

1. **Trigger Strategy:** Initiate playbooks automatically based on incident type, entity, or severity. Allow manual triggering for high-impact actions.
2. **Action Blocks:** Combine enrichment (IP reputation, device lookup), containment (isolate host, disable user), and notification (Teams, email, ITSM) steps.
3. **Approval Gates:** Implement adaptive cards in Teams requiring analyst authorization for disruptive actions.

## Common Automation Patterns

- **Credential Compromise Response:** Disable user, reset password, notify identity team.
- **Ransomware Containment:** Isolate devices, block hash, open P1 ticket, trigger executive alert.
- **Phishing Investigation:** Pull email headers, query similar messages, remove from inbox via Graph API.

## Automation Rules & Incident Management

- Normalize severities, assign to appropriate queues, and tag incidents with playbook outcomes.
- Auto-close benign incidents after validation (e.g., scheduled maintenance alerts).
- Escalate based on SLA breaches or repeated tactics.

## Integration with ITSM & DevOps

- Synchronize incidents with ServiceNow/Jira including bidirectional status updates.
- Create change requests automatically for remediation steps requiring governance.

## Measuring Automation Impact

- Track percentage of incidents with automation coverage.
- Compare MTTR before and after playbook deployment.
- Gather analyst feedback on automation effectiveness to refine logic.

Effective orchestration scales the SOC without compromising oversight or control.
