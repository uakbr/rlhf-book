# Governance, Risk & Compliance

Sentinel simplifies compliance obligations and risk governance through built-in controls.

## Compliance Alignment

- **Out-of-the-Box Content Packs:** Deploy compliance workbooks for ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and NIST CSF.
- **Data Residency & Sovereignty:** Choose regional workspaces and leverage Microsoftâ€™s global compliance portfolio [@microsoftCompliance2024].
- **Audit Trails:** Configure diagnostic settings and activity logs for full change history.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Apply least-privilege via Azure AD roles (Reader, Responder, Automation Contributor).
- Use custom roles for partners or managed service providers.
- Monitor access through access reviews and Privileged Identity Management (PIM).

## Risk Management

- Maintain watchlists for critical assets and VIP users.
- Tag incidents with business impact (financial, regulatory) to prioritize response.
- Integrate with enterprise risk platforms via API or Logic App connectors.

## Policy Enforcement

- **Azure Policy:** Ensure mandatory data connectors stay enabled and data retention meets compliance.
- **Change Control:** Automate approvals for rule changes using Logic Apps and Teams.
- **Evidence Collection:** Store investigation artifacts in immutable storage for legal hold.

## Reporting to Executives & Regulators

- Executive dashboards display SLA adherence, incident severity, and remediation progress.
- Export evidence packages with incident timelines, analyst actions, and response outcomes.
- Use scheduled workbook exports for auditors and board reporting.

Sentinel thus becomes a central control plane for demonstrating compliance and managing cyber risk at enterprise scale.
