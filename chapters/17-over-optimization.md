# Risk Management & Resilience

Microsoft Sentinel supports resilience by embedding safeguards and fallback strategies.

## Resilience Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Maintain layered detections across identity, endpoint, data, and network domains.
- **Fail-Safe Automations:** Design playbooks with rollback steps and clear audit trails.
- **Service Continuity:** Leverage Azure availability zones and disaster recovery strategies for Log Analytics workspaces.

## Rollback Strategy

- Tag pre-change snapshots of rules, workbooks, and playbooks in source control.
- Maintain Git branches for production vs staging content.
- Document rollback procedures and responsible owners in runbooks.

## Testing & Validation

- Execute tabletop exercises and chaos engineering drills to validate response capabilities.
- Simulate ingestion outages and failover scenarios to ensure continuity.

## Incident Communications

- Define escalation matrix and communication templates for executives, regulators, and customers.
- Use Teams/SharePoint to centralize incident updates and documentation.

A resilient Sentinel deployment anticipates disruption, minimizing blast radius and enabling rapid recovery.
