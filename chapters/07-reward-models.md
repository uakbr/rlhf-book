# AI-Augmented Operations

Microsoft Sentinel embeds artificial intelligence to multiply analyst capacity without sacrificing control.

## Fusion Analytics

- Correlates multi-stage attacks using graph-based machine learning trained on trillions of signals daily [@microsoftFusionAI].
- Prioritizes incidents with dynamic severity scoring.
- Provides timeline visualizations of attacker paths.

## User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

- Builds baselines for user logon patterns, device interactions, and resource access.
- Detects anomalies such as impossible travel or atypical privilege escalation.
- Integrates with incident queue for contextual triage.

## Microsoft Security Copilot

- Delivers natural language summaries, recommended next steps, and automated KQL query generation [@microsoftCopilotSecurity].
- Captures analyst feedback to refine future suggestions.
- Offers guardrails via approval workflows to maintain SOC oversight.

## Automation Co-Pilots

- Suggested playbooks appear within incidents based on detection type.
- One-click enrichment collects evidence (device details, user history).
- Integration with Teams enables collaborative triage and war rooms.

## Operational Guidelines

- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Use automation rules to require analyst approval before disruptive actions.
- **Explainability:** Document AI-driven detections and rationales for audit readiness.
- **Continuous Learning:** Review AI outcomes weekly, adjusting models and thresholds to align with business risk.

Combining AI insights with analyst expertise accelerates response while retaining accountability.
