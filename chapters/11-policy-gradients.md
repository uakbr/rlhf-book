# Operational Dashboards & Visualization

Dashboards translate raw telemetry into actionable insights for analysts and executives.

## Workbooks & Custom Dashboards

- Use Azure Monitor Workbooks to create interactive visualizations of incidents, alerts, authentication trends, and automation outcomes.
- Tailor views for audiences: executive scorecards, SOC lead operational dashboards, and engineer-level deep dives.
- Embed metrics such as incident volume, severity distribution, automation coverage, and MITRE technique coverage.

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Description | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MTTD | Mean time to detect threats | < 15 minutes for priority incidents |
| MTTR | Mean time to remediate | < 2 hours for high severity |
| Automation Coverage | % of incidents with playbook execution | > 65% |
| Analyst Efficiency | Alerts handled per analyst per shift | +25% vs baseline |

## Reporting Automation

- Schedule workbook exports to deliver weekly executive updates.
- Use Power BI integration for advanced analytics and cross-domain reporting.
- Create compliance dashboards mapping controls to regulatory frameworks [@microsoftCompliance2024].

## Visualization Best Practices

- Focus on trendlines and percent change to highlight improvement areas.
- Annotate dashboards with major incidents or control changes for context.
- Use consistent color schemes aligned to Microsoft brand guidelines.

Effective visualization drives fact-based decisions, demonstrating SOC performance and value to stakeholders.
