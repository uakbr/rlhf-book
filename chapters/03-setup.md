# Azure Sentinel Platform Overview

Microsoft Sentinel represents a fundamental evolution in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) capabilities. Built as a cloud-native service on Microsoft's Azure platform, Sentinel provides organizations with enterprise-grade security analytics, intelligent automation, and comprehensive threat intelligence in a single, unified solution.

## Platform Architecture and Design Philosophy

Sentinel is designed around three core principles that differentiate it from traditional SIEM solutions:

### Cloud-Native Foundation
- **Built on Azure Monitor:** Sentinel leverages Azure's globally distributed Log Analytics platform, providing virtually unlimited scalability for telemetry ingestion and analysis.
- **Serverless Architecture:** No infrastructure management requiredâ€”Sentinel automatically scales to handle burst traffic, seasonal variations, and organizational growth.
- **Global Reach:** Deployed across 60+ Azure regions worldwide, ensuring data residency compliance and low-latency operations.

### Intelligence-First Approach
- **AI-Infused Analytics:** Machine learning models are embedded throughout the platform, from initial detection to incident investigation and response.
- **Context-Aware Correlation:** Advanced graph-based algorithms understand entity relationships and attack patterns across the entire environment.
- **Continuous Learning:** Models improve over time based on analyst feedback and global threat intelligence.

### Ecosystem Integration
- **Microsoft Security Stack:** Native integration with Microsoft Defender XDR, Entra ID, Purview, and Azure Arc provides unified visibility and control.
- **Open Platform:** REST APIs, webhooks, and community content enable seamless integration with third-party tools and custom applications.
- **Standards Compliance:** Supports industry-standard protocols (CEF, Syslog, TAXII/STIX) for broad compatibility.
