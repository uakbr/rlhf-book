# Adoption Roadmap

A phased deployment approach ensures rapid value realization while managing change.

## Phase 1 – Strategy & Mobilization (Weeks 0–2)

- Establish executive sponsorship and success metrics.
- Inventory existing SIEM/SOAR tooling, processes, and compliance requirements.
- Define scope for proof of concept (POC) including critical use cases and data sources.

## Phase 2 – Foundation (Weeks 2–6)

- Provision Sentinel workspace(s), configure RBAC, enable key data connectors.
- Deploy baseline analytics and automation rules targeting prioritized threats.
- Stand up workbooks for visibility into ingestion health and incident metrics.

## Phase 3 – Expansion (Weeks 6–12)

- Onboard additional data sources (network, SaaS) and custom telemetry.
- Operationalize Security Copilot for investigation support and update playbooks.
- Integrate ITSM and change management systems for end-to-end workflows.

## Phase 4 – Optimization (Weeks 12–18)

- Refine detections based on incident feedback and threat intelligence.
- Extend automation coverage to >65% of incident volume.
- Enable compliance dashboards and executive scorecards.

## Phase 5 – Scale & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

- Expand coverage to subsidiaries and hybrid environments via Azure Arc and Lighthouse.
- Institute quarterly content reviews and tabletop exercises.
- Align Sentinel roadmap with enterprise risk and transformation initiatives.
