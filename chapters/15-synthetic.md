# Proof of Value & Labs

Structured proof-of-value (POV) exercises build stakeholder confidence and accelerate adoption.

## POV Objectives

- Validate Sentinel detections against real-world attack scenarios.
- Measure operational efficiency gains (triage time, automation coverage).
- Demonstrate integration with existing tools and processes.

## Lab Environment Setup

- Use isolated Azure subscriptions with representative workloads and sample data packs.
- Leverage Microsoft-provided simulation environments (e.g., Attack Simulation Lab) to generate realistic telemetry.
- Employ red team tooling or attack simulation frameworks (Atomic Red Team) to execute scenarios.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Critical alert detection rate | > 90% |
| Analyst triage reduction | 40% faster vs baseline |
| Automation execution success | > 95% |
| Stakeholder satisfaction | > 4/5 survey rating |

## POV Governance

- Define entry/exit criteria, roles, and communication cadence.
- Capture lessons learned, enhancements, and adoption blockers.
- Translate successful POV outcomes into business case artifacts.

Well-structured POVs provide evidence for executive approval and inform enterprise rollout strategies.
