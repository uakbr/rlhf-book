# Threat Hunting & Advanced Analytics

Proactive threat hunting supplements automated detection with hypothesis-driven analysis.

## Hunting Framework

1. **Plan:** Define hypotheses aligned to adversary techniques (e.g., lateral movement via service principal abuse).
2. **Collect:** Retrieve relevant logs using KQL, pivoting across entities and time ranges.
3. **Analyze:** Identify anomalies, suspicious patterns, or gaps in coverage.
4. **Respond:** Convert validated findings into analytics rules or playbooks; document lessons.

## Hunting Workbench

- Use Sentinelâ€™s hunting blade for quick-start queries organized by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
- Launch notebooks with integrated threat intelligence for deeper investigation.
- Tag and save queries for reuse, sharing insights across teams.

## Advanced Analytics Techniques

- **Machine Learning:** Bring custom models (e.g., anomaly detection, clustering) via Azure Machine Learning integration.
- **Graph Analysis:** Use Azure Data Explorer to perform graph queries on identity relationships.
- **Query Automation:** Schedule hunts that run periodically, surfacing results to analysts.

## Continuous Improvement Loop

- Review hunt outcomes in weekly forums; prioritize converting high-value hunts into detections.
- Align hunts with intelligence reports and red team findings.
- Measure hunting effectiveness via coverage metrics and detection conversions.

Structured hunting elevates SOC maturity, uncovering stealthy threats before they become incidents.
