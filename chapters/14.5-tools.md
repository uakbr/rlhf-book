# Extended Ecosystem Integrations

Microsoft Sentinel maximizes value when connected to the broader security and operations ecosystem.

## Microsoft Security Stack

- **Microsoft Defender XDR:** Bi-directional incident sharing, advanced hunting integration, shared threat intelligence.
- **Microsoft Entra ID:** Conditional access, identity protection signals, and privileged identity governance.
- **Microsoft Purview:** Data classification and insider risk information enrich Sentinel detections.

## Third-Party Solutions

- Integrate firewalls, proxies, CASB, and endpoint solutions via connectors or APIs.
- Pull vulnerability data from Qualys, Tenable, or Rapid7 to correlate risk with detections.
- Feed Sentinel incidents into ITSM platforms (ServiceNow, Jira) for tracking and remediation.

## DevOps & CloudOps

- Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to version control KQL queries and playbooks.
- Automate infrastructure deployment through Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates.

## Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)

- Azure Lighthouse enables cross-tenant visibility with delegated administration.
- Managed detection and response partners can co-manage workspaces using custom RBAC roles.

## Ecosystem Governance

- Establish change management for shared content (connectors, playbooks).
- Document integration architecture to aid troubleshooting and onboarding.
- Monitor API usage and connector health via workbooks.

A rich integration fabric ensures Sentinel becomes the command center for enterprise defense operations.
