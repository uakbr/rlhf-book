# Incident Response & Investigation

Microsoft Sentinel provides an analyst-centric experience that accelerates incident investigation and facilitates collaboration.

## Incident Lifecycle in Sentinel

1. **Detection & Correlation:** Sentinel correlates alerts into incidents with contextual entities (users, devices, IPs).
2. **Assignment & Prioritization:** Automation rules route incidents to queues based on severity, asset criticality, or geography.
3. **Investigation:** Analysts pivot through alert evidence, timelines, and related entities within the incident workspace.
4. **Containment & Remediation:** Playbooks or manual actions apply remediation steps.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Capture lessons learned, update detections, and document response effectiveness.

## Investigation Tools

- **Investigation Graph:** Visualizes relationships between entities, showing lateral movement paths.
- **Notebook Integration:** Jupyter notebooks with KQL and Python enable advanced analysis.
- **Timeline View:** Displays event chronology for rapid context.

## Collaboration Features

- Add comments, assign tasks, and share incident links across teams.
- Use Teams integration for war room chats, ensuring decisions are recorded.
- Export incident summary PDFs for audit or executive briefings.

## Metrics & Continuous Improvement

- Monitor analyst SLA adherence (acknowledgment time, resolution time).
- Conduct regular post-incident reviews to refine runbooks and analytics.
- Feed new intelligence into watchlists and detection rules.

A streamlined investigation workflow ensures faster containment and more consistent response outcomes.
