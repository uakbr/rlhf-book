# Responsible AI & Data Privacy

Microsoft Sentinel incorporates responsible AI and privacy-by-design principles to maintain trust while leveraging automation.

## Ethical AI Guardrails

- **Transparency:** Security Copilot surfaces the data and reasoning behind recommendations, enabling analyst validation [@microsoftCopilotSecurity].
- **Human Oversight:** Automation rules enforce human approval before executing actions with high business impact.
- **Continuous Review:** SOC leadership reviews AI outcomes to detect drift or bias.

## Data Privacy Controls

- **Data Residency:** Choose regional workspaces and leverage customer-managed keys to meet sovereignty requirements.
- **Access Management:** RBAC and conditional access limit who can view sensitive telemetry.
- **Data Minimization:** Use filtering and truncation to avoid ingesting unnecessary personal data.

## Regulatory Alignment

- Support for GDPR, HIPAA, and industry frameworks through auditing, retention policies, and evidence packages [@microsoftCompliance2024].
- Integration with Microsoft Purview for data classification and governance.

## Responsible Automation Checklist

1. Define approval thresholds and escalation paths.
2. Document data sources feeding AI models.
3. Monitor model performance and update training datasets as threats evolve.
4. Communicate automation usage to stakeholders to ensure transparency.

By embedding responsible AI practices, organizations gain the benefits of automation while protecting user privacy and maintaining compliance.
